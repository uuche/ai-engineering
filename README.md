COVID-19 Forecasting 
Covid-19 has been sepreated all over the world. Origin of Covid-19 virus is Wuhan,China city, now in 185 countries.

# Data Set:
1.Training Set
2.Testing Data Set

# Machine and Deep Learning
 I have used Keras Tensorflow API to build the Model.
 
# Lstm Model Overview 
Long short-term memory is an artificial neural system engineering utilized in the field of profound learning. Not at all like standard feedforward neural systems, LSTM has criticism associations. It can process single information focuses, yet in addition whole successions of information.
SO by using LSTM Model we have predicted future confirmed ,Deaths and active cases .

# Conclusion :
LSTM provides high aaccuarcy as the Model accuracy is above the  98% and  val_loss is 0.0018.
